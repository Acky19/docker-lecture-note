# Docker Security (Docker Scout, SBOM)

Docker security is crucial for maintaining the integrity and safety of your containerized applications. One of the tools available for enhancing Docker security is **Docker Scout**, which helps analyze Docker images for vulnerabilities.

## Docker Scout Commands Overview

### Display Vulnerabilities from a Docker Save Tarball
Analyze vulnerabilities in a Docker image that has been saved as a tarball:
```bash
docker scout cves [OPTIONS] IMAGE | DIRECTORY | ARCHIVE
```
**Example:**
```bash
docker scout cves redis.tar
```
This command scans the `redis.tar` tarball for known vulnerabilities.

### Display Vulnerabilities from an OCI Directory
Analyze vulnerabilities in a Docker image stored in an OCI (Open Container Initiative) directory. You can use Skopeo to copy the image:
```bash
skopeo copy --override-os linux docker://alpine oci:redis
```
This command copies the Alpine image into an OCI directory named `redis`, allowing you to analyze it for vulnerabilities.

### Export Vulnerabilities to a SARIF JSON File
Export detected vulnerabilities to a SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) JSON file:
```bash
docker scout cves --format sarif --output redis.sarif.json redis
```
This command generates a `redis.sarif.json` file containing the vulnerabilities found in the `redis` Docker image.

### Comparing Two Images
Compare vulnerabilities between two Docker images:
```bash
docker scout compare --to redis:6.0 redis:6-bullseye
```
This command compares the vulnerabilities in the `redis:6.0` and `redis:6-bullseye` Docker images.

### Displaying a Quick Overview of an Image
Get a quick summary of the vulnerabilities in a Docker image:
```bash
docker scout quickview redis:6.0
```
This command provides a quick overview of vulnerabilities found in the `redis:6.0` Docker image.

## Important Notes
- The commands provided are part of the **Docker Scout** tool, which may not be included in the standard Docker installation. You may need to install Docker Scout separately.
- Skopeo is an additional tool used for copying container images between different formats and locations.
- Always refer to the latest Docker Scout documentation for the most up-to-date command options and capabilities.

## Conclusion
By incorporating Docker Scout and other security tools into your workflow, you can significantly reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in your Docker images. Regular scanning and analysis of your images ensure that your containerized applications remain secure and compliant.
